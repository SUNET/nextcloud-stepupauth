      Step up authentication for Nextcloud

    longDescription: >
      Accounts created in Nextcloud with a
      SSO provider (saml, ldap, global 
      site selector) can not currently use
      native Nextcloud Multi Factor 
      Authentication (MFA). 

      Nextcloud expects an Identity 
      Provider (IdP) to do MFA prior to 
      logging in to Nextcloud. This is 
      confusing to users who can still see
      the settings for MFA in their security
      settings and it is not allways feasable
      for IdPs to implement MFA. Instead this
      app allows administrators to enable 
      users to do step up authentication in 
      Nextcloud, that is, provide a higher 
      level of assurance of identity within 
      Nextcloud, than what is provided by the
      IdP.

      The only thing that this app does is to
      provide the same behaviour for SSO 
      accounts as for local accounts. That 
      means that you can configure groups in 
      which users are required to have (or be
      excluded from having) MFA configured for
      their account. Users who are required to
      have MFA enabled, but have not yet configured
      a provider, will be prompted upon first login
      after requirement is enabled. The users can
      also voluntarily enable and disable MFA 
      providers on their own volition if no external
      requirements are enforced. The documentation
      for MFA in Nextcloud is available here:
